PRODIGY INFOTECH INTERNSHIP TASK 2

Task was to Build a program that generates a random number and  the user to guess it. The program should prompt the user to input their guess, 
compare it to the generated number, and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
It will continue until the user correctly guesses the number and then display the number of attempts it took to win the game.


Here is a detailed description of the problem:

Problem: Guessing Game using PyQt5

Description:

Create a graphical user interface (GUI) application using PyQt5 that implements a number guessing game. 
The game should generate a random number between 1 and 100, and challenge the user to guess it. 
The application should provide feedback to the user based on their guesses, indicating whether their guess is too high or too low. 
The game should continue until the user correctly guesses the number, at which point it should display the number of attempts it took to win the game.

Requirements:

    The application should generate a random number between 1 and 100.
    The user should be able to input their guess using a text field.
    The application should provide feedback to the user based on their guess, indicating whether it is too high or too low.
    The game should continue until the user correctly guesses the number.
    The application should display the number of attempts it took to win the game when the user correctly guesses the number.
    The application should have a GUI with a label, text field, button, and result label.

Constraints:

    The application should use PyQt5 as the GUI framework.
    The random number should be generated using the random module.
    The application should handle invalid user input (e.g., non-numeric input).

Goals:

    Create a functional GUI application using PyQt5.
    Implement a number guessing game with feedback to the user.
    Provide a user-friendly interface for the game.

the concepts learned from this problem:

1. PyQt5 Basics: * Creating a GUI application using PyQt5 * Understanding the basic widgets (QLabel, QLineEdit, QPushButton, etc.) * Layout management (QVBoxLayout)

2. Event Handling: * Understanding how to connect signals to slots (e.g., button clicks) * Handling user input (e.g., text field input)

3. Random Number Generation: * Using the random module to generate a random number * Understanding how to generate a random number within a specific range (1-100)

4.  Game Logic: * Implementing the game logic to compare the user's guess to the generated number * Understanding how to keep track of the number of attempts

5. Code Organization: * Organizing code into a single class (GuessingGame) * Understanding how to separate concerns and keep the code modular
